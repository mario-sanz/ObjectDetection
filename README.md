# About my code #

The app can be tested in any browser by opening ```http://0.0.0.0:5000/``` after executing the code.

Notice that to be able to execute the code, all the requirements should be installed. For that, you can run the command ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` on the project root directory.

Stars in GitHub are appreciated!
